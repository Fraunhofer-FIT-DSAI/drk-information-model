<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Culture Ontology serves as a foundational building block of the Culture Information Model (Culture IM), specifically designed for the Culture Dataspace (DRK: Datenraum Kultur). It offers an extensible and comprehensive vocabulary for modeling metadata related to theaters, theatrical productions, and showtimes. Key concepts within the ontology include theatrical events, characters, roles, venue accessibility, and event scheduling. Addressing the challenges of data interoperability in the culture domain, particularly in the performing arts sector, the Culture Ontology enables structured data representation that enhances the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) of cultural data. By integrating with access and usage policies as well as application profiles, the Culture Ontology promotes seamless data exchange and management across diverse cultural institutions. Its modular and scalable design ensures it can adapt to various use cases, paving the way for innovative solutions in cultural heritage and performance management.</span>
