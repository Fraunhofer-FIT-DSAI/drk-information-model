<span class="markdown">The Culture ontology (aka DRK ontology) is designed for the Culture Dataspace, providing extensible semantic concepts, properties, and their interrelationships for modeling metadata in the culture domain. It comprises common modules for cross-cutting concepts (such as organizations, places, creative works, events, and roles) and domain-specific modules (such as those tailored to theater showtimes). The ontology is extensible and allows the addition of new modules, for sectors such as museums or music marketplaces, as future use cases arise.</span>
