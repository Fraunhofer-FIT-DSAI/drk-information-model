  <p class="intro-paragraph">The Culture ontology (also known as the DRK ontology) is developed as the semantic backbone of the Culture Dataspace. It provides an extensible and modular vocabulary for describing metadata in the cultural domain, enabling interoperable, sovereign, and semantically rich data sharing across diverse cultural sectors.</p>
  
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>Core Features:</strong> The Culture ontology defines common modules for cross-cutting concepts—such as organizations, places and accessibility, creative works, events, roles, and data services—which are applicable across a wide range of cultural domains.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>In addition, it includes domain-specific modules for specialized use cases, such as theater showtimes, and is designed to support future extensions for sectors like museums, music education, or marketplaces for creative content.</p>
  
  <div class="two-column">
    <div class="column">
      <p><strong>Technical Foundation:</strong> The ontology builds on widely adopted web standards by using Schema.org as its foundational vocabulary. It also integrates and reuses concepts from DCAT for data services and distribution, and reengineers A11yJSON to describe accessibility-related features of cultural places.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The resulting model promotes interoperability with existing systems and facilitates reuse by data providers and consumers. To accommodate the diversity of cultural data, the Culture ontology follows a modular and extensible design.</p>
