# Culture Information Model (Culture IM / DRK IM)
- The Culture IM is a Semantic Information Model that aims to define formal specifications of concepts, relationships, and constraints (application profiles) within the culture dataspace. This formalization provides a structured framework for understanding and organizing information within the DRK project. In addition, this forms a basis for representing information in DRK in the form of a Knowledge Graph (Culture KG) with more advanced querying, inference, and reasoning capabilities.
- It contains the Culture Ontology and several controlled vocabularies as listed below.
